Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian Undergraduate Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CUCAI) has decided to move our 2021 conference to a fully online format. Our team has been closely monitoring the situation and at this time, we believe that this is the best approach for the health and safety of our attendees given recommendations from public health. Nevertheless, we are committed to providing the same caliber of connections, experiences, and events to all attendees. We are excited for the increased accessibility that this online format will provide and are excited to make connections beyond geographic boundaries in order to create a conference that will truly represent the Canadian AI landscape. We look forward to providing an enriching online experience and look forward to seeing you at our virtual event!

We are committed to improving the quality of the experience for all guests at CUCAI 2021, despite the obstacles posed by COVID 19, and are excited to have you join us as we tackle this adversity to deliver the most successful CUCAI to date.
